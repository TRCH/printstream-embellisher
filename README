A small library that wraps stdout and stderr (PrintStream) and appends the thread name and stack frame of the method
that invoked System.out.println or System.err.println. Currently the other methods in PrintStream aren't fully supported.

To activate this functionality simple add

new SystemPrintStreamEmbellisherBootstrap(true).init();

OR

new SystemPrintStreamEmbellisherBootstrap().init(); AND set the JVM flag system.printstream.embellisher.enabled to true.

Example:

public class Client {

	public static void main(String[] args) throws FileNotFoundException {
		new SystemPrintStreamEmbellisherBootstrap().init();
		System.out.println("info");
		System.err.println("error");
	}
}

info [ thread = main, frame = com.trch.Client.main(Client.java:10) ]
error [ thread = main, frame = com.trch.Client.main(Client.java:11) ]



My main reason for writing this was when working with complex stacks it is sometimes difficult to determine who is writing to stderr or stdout.
This is more of a POC. If I need more from it in the future I'll enhance it.
